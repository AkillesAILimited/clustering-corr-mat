Clustering coefficients for correlation matrices

    Local and global clustering coefficients for correlation matrices.

    Function corrmat_C_PHA calculates C^{cor,P}, C^{cor,H}, C^{cor,A} and their local variants (i.e. C_i's)

    Function corrmat_C_M calculates C^{cor,M} and its local variant

    Example usage is shown after the two functions.
